# Retained fork changes for upstream merges

## Merge policy

Keep the fork's Tahoe fixes, existing performance optimizations, OpenGL/Minecraft changes and
MoltenVK optimizations when merging upstream. This policy was confirmed on 2026-10-17.

Before each merge:

1. Fetch the requested upstream revision and inspect its changes since the previous merge.
2. Check for both textual conflicts and changes to the behavior listed below. A clean Git merge
   does not establish compatibility.
3. Check whether upstream has already implemented each fix. Use its implementation when it fully
   covers the retained behavior; keep any remaining fork-specific repair. Avoid applying equivalent
   fixes twice, and inspect overlapping code before resolving a conflict.
4. Build the affected components and check their behavior, resource lifetime and synchronization.
   Record which fork changes upstream now covers, what remains local and the validation limits.

The current upstream base is **2.6.4 at `f95f4d2`**, from `upstream/main`, integrated on
2026-10-29. The preceding base was 2.6.3 at `190a4d4`, integrated on 2026-10-28.

## Capture import reuse and planar GPU copies

Preserve the installer/uninstaller permanent-path repair: recover obsolete
temporary collection references only through an unambiguous installed bundle
ID/version match. Published removal collections must use permanent `-p` paths,
preserve non-default external extensions, and verify retained IDs both before
and after publication. Keep firmware in removal rollback and the check-only
uninstaller mode. Never publish a collection whose dependencies live only in a
temporary staging repository that cleanup deletes.

Retain the bounded IOSurface import cache and shared page-span calculation from
PR #3. Cache only released wrapper imports, retaining the surface while idle;
keep count/byte/idle/age limits, opt-outs, separate host-page accounting and GPU
cleanup outside its mutex. Do not broaden this into reuse of in-flight buffers
or replace the stable parked backing without an import-invalidation contract.
Host imports must stay within the owned mapping, use a texel-aligned offset and
one overflow-checked span for both upload and readback. Preserve CPU fallback.

Keep the three-word `NVMTLVramAt:pN` tag shared with Minecraft/Wine and Zink.
The PR's incompatible four-word pending tag and capture-reader polling are
excluded. Preserve the existing kernel-gated conditional completion, overlapping
writer counts, deferred publication and uncertain-work quarantine. There is no
new cross-process busy-wait or encoder change. See
[capture review](CAPTURE-PR3-REVIEW.md) for the OBS path analysis, pixel tests and
remaining live-application/hardware validation limits.

## Native Zink OpenGL integration

Preserve `zink/` and its pinned Mesa overlay, build/packaging tools and local
validation probes. The native GLD is intended to select Zink/NVK automatically
for normal OpenGL apps and OpenGL Minecraft, without a mod, attach call or
launch argument. Its private CGL ABI was tested on x86_64 Tahoe 25G241.
The user requested removal of the exact OS-build activation/build/install gate
on 2026-10-30 and will test later macOS updates. Preserve that policy: a build
number change alone must not disable Zink. Private ABI changes can still
require a repair. Keep build provenance, symbol/slot/profile/device checks
and Sequoia/Tahoe accelerator selection; these are not an OS-build whitelist.
The 15.8.1 / 24H32 collection matches all 1,236 public dispatch entries and 131
Apple GLD exports, together with the private dispatch/profile/share offsets.
Retain the [static ABI review](ZINK-SEQUOIA-ABI.json) and distinguish that evidence
from application/boot qualification. The Sequoia RTX 2070 SUPER / 256 MiB BAR1
machine subsequently passed all 25 isolated tests (native pixel copies, core/
legacy contexts, sharing, resize, workers, windows, VSync and quarantine).
The user subsequently confirmed Minecraft 26.3 menus and single-player world
rendering on this Sequoia machine after the small-BAR mapping repair; see
[mapping evidence](ZINK-BUFFER-MAPPING.md). This does not qualify a fresh
Sequoia kernel-collection build or every application.
The shared adapter
continues targeting macOS 15.5; do not copy Apple binaries into the runtime.
The Zink package builder selects the GLD by default. Keep the original complete
base-package builder and its Minecraft/Wine/dual-OS support, then add the Zink
payload with `build/package_zink.py`. A local test build is not a release.

Retain private frontend/renderer selection, one process-owned GPU screen with
separate GL share groups, framebuffer invalidation after swap/resize, GPU VRAM
copy/dirty/generation-tag ordering and per-context native targets. Keep strict
same-device checks and uncertain-work quarantine. GPU IOSurface/Apple
presentation is a compatibility/comparison path, never a reason to execute
application shaders in Apple's OpenGL renderer outside the explicit client
compatibility options below, or silently use CPU pixels.
Keep the Zink batch condition-variable and Darwin barrier repairs; the latter
must have one serial return only after every other waiter leaves. Compare an
equivalent upstream fix before removing either repair. Preserve the descriptor-
set, staging-upload and bounded texture-worker fixes in the pinned overlay.

Preserve the small-BAR CPU-visible buffer allocation policy, including both
persistent storage and ordinary mutable buffers. Prefer coherent system RAM
for their backing; retain full-BAR placement and device-only VRAM resources.
Keep null-transfer handling after failed maps and allocation diagnostics.
The 8 KiB static/dynamic regression must cover the 2 MiB backing slab, not just
PBO allocations (which Mesa already classifies as staging).

Keep native display synchronization tied to each context's CGL swap interval,
including render-thread changes and independent windows. Preserve the explicit
`NVKZINK_DISABLE=1` diagnostic opt-out before any GL objects are created.
OBS 33.0.1's compatibility mode is enabled by default and checked only for
`com.obsproject.obs-studio`. An explicit false `NVKZinkCaptureCompatibility`
preference or process-local `NVKZINK_OBS_COMPAT=0` opts out; an explicit `1`
environment override wins over a saved preference. The mode keeps
the whole OBS context in Apple's driver and changes RGBA16F ScreenCaptureKit
requests to BGRA8. Never switch an existing context's object namespace or enable
this mode globally. The user confirms moving OBS capture after a normal launch
on RTX 2060 SUPER / Tahoe 26.7.1; this qualifies the SDR compatibility mode,
not native Zink IOSurface imports, HDR capture or encoder performance. See
[the setup and rollback](ZINK-OPENGL.md#obs-display-capture-compatibility).

Preserve native GLD rollback, build provenance and external-kext preservation during
both preflight and live kernel-collection builds. Do not replace permanent
external kext paths with disposable preflight paths. See
[Zink integration review](ZINK-PR2-REVIEW.md) for the review and validation limits.

## Upstream 2.6.4 integration

Take sampler-array lowering, texture-array element routing through the per-draw
bindless table, and bounded rewriting of older inline constexpr samplers. Keep
the fork's typed-pointer/address-table/local-pointer and RGB10A2 `NoContraction`
repairs, pointer-escape guards, vector-prefix bounds and GL constant-buffer path.
Sampler arrays use one scalar descriptor per element, matching the plugin's
count-one bindings; preserve the 16-slot and metadata/type consistency checks.

Four files conflicted: the changelog and ANGLE, submission-copy and surface-
publication fixtures. Preserve both changelog histories and the stronger fork
fixtures: all-app ANGLE, uncertain-use/retirement state, imported-host-page and
CPU-fallback publication locking. Do not reintroduce the excluded PR 398 foreign-
process busy wait. Take the other upstream fixture updates; the resource-phi
harness needs the current Cargo dependency directory via `--deps`.

The added IOPCIFamily dependency in `kexts/NVRM/fb/Info.plist` already exists in
`kexts/NVRMFB/fb/Info.plist`, which this fork builds. All plugin, NVRMFB, NVAccel
and NVRMAGDC implementation trees remain byte-identical to their verified
producing sources. Reuse those fork binaries, including both 15/26 accelerator
variants, with recorded hashes. Use the official 2.6.4 RM, firmware, codecs,
installer and version data. Repeat isolated Tahoe kernel linking with that RM;
its executable hash differs from 2.6.3. The bundled NVK renderer is unchanged.

Rebuild the merged translator and both native frontends; include the compiled
D3D12/DLSS prefix helper and matched DXVK/vkd3d/NGX/NVAPI components. Checks pass:
2,217 translator library tests; 43 wrapper tests with two upstream ignored and
two private-fixture exclusions; 50 focused integrations; 36 driver host scripts;
21 GPU shader readback cases/28 dispatches; both frontend ASan/UBSan fixtures;
45 pixel-verified presentation frames with resize/restore per frontend; real
D3D11/D3D12 rendering and DLSS evaluation; 19 setup checks and three real Wine
registry/rollback scenarios. Isolated Tahoe kernel linking passes. Local records
are under `/Volumes/Games/driver-2.6.4-review/`.

The final package still needs physical boot/application testing. Sequoia kernel
linking, other GPUs, commercial CrossOver, DLSSG and ray tracing remain
unqualified. Earlier user-confirmed four-monitor rotation and ZZZ/HSR/DLSS
results apply to the retained implementations, not a new boot test. Upstream
still reports overly dark WebGL shadows; sampler/texture-array fixes do not
establish that this separate rendering issue is resolved. No FPS gain is claimed.

## Upstream 2.6.3 integration

Nine files had textual conflicts: the changelog, framebuffer, plugin device/event/library/Vulkan
sources, GL performance fixture, translator inliner and wrapper. Preserve both release histories.
The merge includes the following equivalences and decisions:

- Upstream now includes the original GL constant-buffer/shadow PR and native rotation adaptation.
  Keep each implementation once. Retain the later 16-sampler retry, bounded vector-prefix loads,
  descriptor-array/pointer-escape guards, committed GL resource snapshots and the stronger cursor,
  identity and current-mode repairs. Keep both physical-address fallback and uniform-table exports.
- Take the typed immutable pointer-field forwarding, instruction-metadata parsing, native math,
  buffer-helper/write-only shader repairs, MPS imageblock handling and Fx hashing. Preserve the
  fork's sampler/A8/threadgroup retry options and AIR-based uniform eligibility.
- Take the submit-ahead queue and part-retirement locking; lower the fork's committed-resource
  uses under that same retirement lock. Keep uncertain-fence quarantine, conditional WindowServer
  completion and capture/page-off ordering. The separate PR 398 foreign-process busy-tag polling
  remains excluded, as in the prior fork; it is not required by native rotation or the new caches.
- Take retained host-page imports/readback, application surface-upload scheduling, sampler-slot
  restoration, framebuffer-fetch descriptor reuse and asynchronous shader-cache writes/touches.
  Keep per-surface publication locking, descriptor/sampler caches, submission-copy discovery,
  strict stencil detection, bounded badge mip tracking and release `-O2`.
- Keep ANGLE Metal enabled by default for every app, with existing overrides and the opt-out.
  Upstream's broader browser/framework detector still narrows the policy and is unnecessary here.
  Retain the tested Chromium GPU-process/bridge-access decoder policy and native service delegation.
- Take backlight persistence, display-audio mapping/refresh, raster bounds and HiDPI mode flags.
  Keep the DVI startup timing repair, Tahoe-only rotation/opt-outs, scale-list ownership, per-head
  identities and stable current timing IDs. Successful modesets refresh audio and cursor geometry.
- Take upstream's main RM BAR1 placement/utilization and optional Intel-panel/HDA changes. Reuse
  its matching release RM and unchanged NVK renderer rather than trying to link unavailable vendor
  Darwin archives. Both OS accelerator variants must include the new utilization interface.

Git's automatic merge silently concatenated both cursor-position transforms. Replace that result
with the fork's existing locked 64-bit coordinate path; otherwise positions would rotate twice.
Keep its kernel-priority ONCE worker, exported cancellation and accepted-work drain. The ordinary
audio worker joins the generic cleanup list; the cursor remains outside that list.

Use the official **2.6.3** package for RM, HDA/Intel extensions, codecs, firmware, installer and
version metadata. Rebuild the release plugin, translator, NVRMFB and both 15/26 NVAccel variants;
retain the coordinated AGDC stable-slot binary after source/hash verification. Include both the
Minecraft runtime and compact Wine/NVK provider/DXVK pair. Their sources and renderer ABI are
unchanged by this merge. Release preparation does not overwrite the manual Downloads/pkgroot.

Initial validation records are under `out/upstream-2.6.3-merge-20261028-111911/`. The native translator's
initial full library run reported 2191 passes, 17 failures and one ignored test; all 17 failures also occurred
on untouched upstream 2.6.3 under the same tools. The wrapper has 43 passes and two ignored tests;
two tests needing unpublished local AIR files are filtered explicitly. Focused shader integration
and host tests cover the retained repairs and new cache/audio/retirement behavior. This is not a
fully passing upstream suite, a hardware boot, a four-monitor repair confirmation or an FPS result.
The release plugin/translator, framebuffer and both accelerator variants compile. Thirty host
scripts, two C++ harnesses, 22 focused Rust integration cases and the GL C-ABI translation checks
pass. Package manifests/signatures and isolated Tahoe kernel-collection linking pass. Sequoia
kernel linking, physical boot and application/multi-monitor testing remain outstanding.

## Translator repair following 2.6.3

Retain strict typed-pointer address-space parsing, consistent direct/helper
`array_ref<void>` address-table access, generic pointer-table loads and real 64-bit
device addresses in local pointer stores, including derived offsets. Preserve the
RGB10A2 residual FMA's `NoContraction` decoration; GPU half-way rounding controls
fail without it. These are correctness repairs, not an FPS claim.

The refreshed tests recognize shared guarded-load helpers and bindless resource
slots while checking the actual data flow. Keep the positive callback/local-store
regressions and bounded GPU readback harness. Do not restore the old expected
callback rejection, ignored duplicate, exact diagnostic strings or obsolete fixed
texture bindings. Compare equivalent upstream implementations before future merges.

The repaired full library suite passes 2,210 tests, with no failures or ignored
tests. See [Translator validation](TRANSLATOR-VALIDATION.md) for coverage and wrapper
fixture exclusions. Local repair records are under
`out/translator-repair-20261028-122757/`. The isolated release replaces only the
translator; previously verified kext/plugin/runtime binaries retain their producing
commit and hashes. No live installation or new Downloads/pkgroot is part of this work.

## Native NVK runtime for Minecraft 26.3

Retain the optional frontend and build/test tools in `nvk/native-macos/`, alongside
the [NVK Bridge mod](https://github.com/HighDelay/minecraft-nvk). This does not change
the installed plugin, default Vulkan provider, framebuffer or existing Metal,
OpenGL and MoltenVK paths. An instance opts in by installing the companion mod
and selecting Minecraft's Vulkan backend; the runtime manifest is validated before selection.

Keep application Vulkan objects on the private renderer's device, with local symbol
resolution and a distinct renderer install name. Preserve stable swapchain images,
separate drawable reservations, queue synchronization, completion before dirty/tag
publication and retained resources after uncertain GPU completion. Normal presentation
copies on the GPU; do not replace it with a CPU pixel transfer or import foreign-device
Vulkan handles. When changing NVK or the driver, check the version-3 IOSurface import
record, `nvmtl_nvk_stage_import`, `nvmtl_nvk_surface_dirty` and VRAM generation tags
against the bundled renderer before rebuilding the runtime.

Preserve optional staging of both OS accelerator variants and the curated Minecraft
runtime under `Library/GPUBundles/nvmtl/minecraft`. Keep the bundled renderer's
Sequoia 15.5 minimum, the frontend's 15.0 deployment target, compatibility
checks, manifest/hash/signature validation and independent 15/26 checksum manifests.
The existing installer chooses the OS variant and manages the runtime through its
ordinary nvmtl copy/removal path; keep default Vulkan selection opt-in through the
companion mod. Mod 0.1.2+ discovers that installed directory automatically; explicit
custom paths take priority and `nvkbridge.enabled=false` must still disable selection.

RTX 2060 SUPER/Tahoe 26.7.1 tests cover actual device requirements, SDL presentation,
pixel checks, resize/restore, LWJGL/SDL provider equality, Fabric Essential gameplay
and a NeoForge 26.3.0.99 game session confirmed by the user and its native NVK log.
Other GPUs, broad WSI conformance and a controlled performance
comparison remain unqualified. See [Native Vulkan presentation](../nvk/native-macos/README.md).

## Native NVK runtime for Wine / DXVK

Retain `nvk/wine-macos/`, `tools/wine-nvk/` and the shared frontend's
`NVKBRIDGE_WINE` build mode. This adds opt-in Wine support without changing the
plugin, framebuffer, desktop presentation or default Vulkan provider. The Wine
frontend exports `vkCreateMetalSurfaceEXT` directly through the same guarded
implementation as proc-address lookup. Preserve Wine-only filtering of unsupported
WSI/HDR/external-handle extensions and queries, the private staged IOSurface
import, stable swapchain images and completion/lifetime rules from Minecraft.
Resize of a valid drawable returns OUT_OF_DATE so Wine can recreate its chain.

Keep the matched DXVK 3.1.1 shared-resource fallback repair, source/license records,
`dxvk.enableDescriptorBuffer = False` default, and paired DLL install/rollback
journal. A rejected external-sharing request must not call an unavailable Win32
export function. Do not advertise general GPU-handle sharing or fake successful
exports. Descriptor sets restored ZZZ characters and HUD text in an actual A/B test.

Preserve optional `--wine-runtime` staging of the compact provider under
`Library/GPUBundles/nvmtl/wine`, separate from Minecraft. Validate the manifest,
hashes, signatures, Intel architecture, macOS 15.5 compatibility, provider alias,
licenses and checksums before publishing. YAAGL release archives contain launchers
only; Wine downloads on first setup, while NVK and the matched DXVK pair come
from the installed driver provider. Prefix DLL originals must
remain restorable after a runtime update, including interrupted operations.

YAAGL integration is maintained in HighDelay/yaagl-nvk, repaired DXVK in
HighDelay/dxvk-nvk (`nvk-3.1.1`). YAAGL requires the installed driver provider;
there is no bundled renderer fallback or separate DXVK download. Its private
Wine archive is checksum-pinned and prepared without altering ordinary Wine.
An identical DXVK pair can adopt the provider identity
without replacing original DLL backups; a different pair still requires restore.
ZZZ and Honkai: Star Rail Global D3D11 gameplay are user-confirmed on RTX 2060
SUPER / Tahoe 26.7.1 with YAAGL Wine 11.0-1, including scenery, characters and UI.
HSR uses its Jadeite route with the required `--` separator; Steam Patch and the
timeout fix default off for HSR/GI and on for ZZZ. Preserve these game-specific
defaults. GI, CN gameplay, commercial CrossOver, other Wine builds and Sequoia
hardware remain unqualified.
Native and Windows Vulkan/D3D11 probes verify correctness, not an FPS improvement.
D3D12 integration now includes pinned vkd3d-proton 3.1, optional NVIDIA Wine
NGX/DXVK-NVAPI, and a GPU-copy bitmap HUD. ZZZ D3D12 and DLSS SR Quality were
user-confirmed on RTX 2060 SUPER / Tahoe 26.7.1. Preserve the independent D3D11,
vkd3d and DLSS rollback journals, prefix-local registry original, signature/hash
validation, `WINE_NVK_*` child-process forwarding and the D3D11 default. DLSSG
keeps normal hardware checks; frame generation and RT are unqualified. The final
registry-aware helper now passes compiled DLL/registry rollback tests in private
Wine prefixes. Build validation is recorded in the 2.6.4 integration above.

## Tahoe display rotation

The current local candidate uses the native CoreDisplay rotation approach from
`0700c208` in PR 398, with fork repairs. Its separate surface-busy/wait commit
`566c1307` is excluded. Do not restore the extra producer compute/CPU correction,
output pools or old mode/copy/GPU protocols: they would apply rotation twice.
WindowServer owns pixel rotation and the ordinary presentation path scans out
its physical raster. Keep conditional completion/capture synchronization.

Retain the native rotated-mode publication, timing-ID matching and aliases,
224-entry macOS timing capacity, full-raster/reflection/allocation checks,
aligned timing copies and per-display cursor bitmap/hotspot/geometry mapping.
Keep the consistent current-mode-ID repair: adopt a matching replacement ID and
its descriptor persistently, and make `getCurrentDisplayMode` a read-only query.
Do not restore `fNewIdOnce` or an equivalent query-consumed answer. Preserve the
previous ID only when unambiguous and capacity permits; retain an omitted active
timing without shadowing a reassigned ID or reporting the boot mode as active.
Existing scaling overrides must survive; replace/remove only the scale array
published by this instance. A first-frame reconnect must use the deferred
connection worker, never call the family from inside the presentation gate.

Keep the indexed IOService location on each NVRMDisplay provider before the
framebuffer starts and the controller's path/registry-ID check. Preserve the
kernel-priority ONCE cursor call, accepted-work count, exported cancellation,
shutdown drain, display gate and cursor-state locking. The native approach does
not replace these lifetime repairs, parked backing, BAR1 budgets or scanout guards.

Enable rotation only on Darwin 25, preserving property/`nvrmrotation=0` opt-outs.
Use implementation marker 14 and native accelerator protocol 1. Reject nonzero
probes without a matching accelerator on the same PCI device; Standard restore
remains available. Rebuild NVRMFB, Tahoe NVAccel and the release plugin together.
Upstream 2.6.3 now includes the original rotation adaptation. Keep its fork repairs
once rather than applying rotation twice. The separate surface-busy wait from
PR 398 remains excluded.

Earlier four-monitor RTX 3070 captures exposed wrong-monitor rotation, mode fallback
and mirroring; initial snapshots alone missed later failures. On 2026-10-28 the
same tester confirmed all four displays working, with both Dell P2214H displays
in portrait. The maintainer also reports working rotation with the second DVI
monitor on RTX 2060 SUPER. Exact four-monitor release/binary identity and the
necessity of individual repairs were not established. See
[Display rotation](DISPLAY-ROTATION.md) for the reports and remaining test limits.

The local controller-separation test adds `NVRMDisplayIndex` as the stable driver
slot, preferred by both NVAccel and NVRMAGDC with the older dependent-index fallback.
Keep PCI ownership, range/type/duplicate checks and Intel slot 4. When explicitly
enabled, secondary heads receive distinct controller IDs before family startup,
with local dependent index zero; head zero keeps the Intel-compatible legacy group.
`nvfbcontrollers=0`, rotation disablement and non-Tahoe kernels preserve shared
grouping. The three kexts must be staged together. Host checks pass, but the earlier
four-head capture still mirrored with this repair installed. The later consistent
timing-ID repair passes host mode/metadata tests. The subsequent successful user
report does not isolate either change as the mirroring fix. Keep controller
splitting disabled in ordinary packages and retain the independent identity and
timing-reporting correctness repairs.

## DVI startup timing validation

Retain `nvrm-dvi-modes.h` and its startup call before the boot raster/scanout is
established. Digital DVI-D/DVI-I must keep an already-valid timing; an invalid
one may use only a same-visible-resolution progressive mode accepted by both
indexed and explicit NVKMS validation. Preserve the nearest-refresh choice,
bounded enumeration and unchanged output on failure. Do not hardcode 1080p75,
force dual-link, disable EDID/link checks or carry over the diagnostic ioctl helper.
Keep explicit validation on KAPI-generated DVI refresh modes and the EDID match
shortcut. Other connector types retain their selection; presentation, cursor,
rotation, parked backing and public KAPI dependencies are unchanged.

The RTX 2060 SUPER/ITY V2422F test boot selected 1080p75 after rejecting 1080p60;
both DVI and HDMI modesets succeeded and the user confirmed output. That test
used shared controller grouping. Other GPUs/adapters and independent four-head
rotation remain unqualified. See [DVI modes](DVI-MODES.md).

## Historical upstream 2.6.2 integration

Upstream adds four commits after 2.5.5, changing only `package/install.sh` and
`CHANGELOG.md`. Resolve the changelog conflict by retaining the fork entries and
adding the 2.6.0, 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 release notes. Keep the installer as provided.

The installer queries existing no-team kext approvals and refreshes a signed
bundle's stored load-history hash only when its bundle is already allowed.
Unsigned bundles do not gain a signing requirement; first installs retain the
normal approval guidance. If every selected extension is already allowed, the
installer reports that the update takes one restart. Database-write failures
remain nonfatal and print the upstream note; that approval count is not proof
of a successful hash update or of the next boot's actual approval state.

No rendering, kernel, translator, native NVK, firmware or build source changed.
There are no new equivalents of the fork's DVI repair, rotation/controller
identities, cursor shutdown/drain, decoder policy, all-app ANGLE default or
OpenGL/Minecraft/MoltenVK follow-ups. Preserve them without applying another copy.
Compiled source retention is checked against fork `7004150`; no driver rebuild
is needed for this upstream delta.

Validation covers installer shell syntax, isolated approval-database fixtures,
existing installer/package checks and byte-for-byte retention of the protected
source. The fixtures use temporary databases and mocked signatures, not the live
KextPolicy database. They do not qualify macOS approval prompts or boot behavior.
Records are identified by `out/upstream-merge-latest.json`. This source merge
does not push, stage a package or alter the installed driver. When staging a
2.6.2 release, use its installer and version/dependency metadata with the retained
fork builds and native Minecraft runtime.

## Historical upstream 2.5.5 integration

Two files had textual conflicts: `CHANGELOG.md` and `plugin/NVMTLDevice.m`.
Keep both histories. Upstream's Discord decoder repair (`9a00f88`) covers the same
registration regression as the fork, but delegates only when a sandboxed process
has a `com.apple.*` bundle identifier. It registers in every other sandboxed
client without checking accelerator access. Retain the fork's tested policy:
only an exact Chromium GPU-process type with both RM bridge connections available
gets local registration; all other native sandboxed clients retain service decoding.
Keep service exceptions, cached probes, connection cleanup and codec-disable guards.
This preserves the Discord and QuickTime behavior already tested on the fork,
without adding a second registrar or relying on a bundle-name allowlist. Adapt
upstream's sandbox fixture to exercise the retained production policy and denied access.

Upstream's Brave and Edge additions are already covered by the fork's all-app
ANGLE Metal default. Preserve that default, existing overrides and the opt-out.

Take the same-size buffer-texture view repair (`86083d2`). A mutable linear/DRM
buffer alias now lists the device-supported compatible formats, including BGRA/RGBA
reinterpretation used by screen capture. Require the image's own format and every
requested usage feature, validate the combined list against the device, and keep
unlisted or wrong-size views refused. Failed or unavailable capability queries
fall back to the original single-format image. Keep `vfl` mask checks in resource
migration/purge eligibility, alongside the fork's caches and lifetime guards.

Take the NVAccel refusal-log throttle (`f675901`): first eight refusals and then
every 256th, while counting every refusal. It changes no allocation decision,
parked backing, scanout, BAR1 budget, flip or completion policy. The framebuffer,
main RM, translator, NVK, rotation, cursor serialization/drain and existing
OpenGL/MoltenVK optimizations are unchanged by this integration. No equivalent
upstream native-rotation or cursor shutdown/drain repair was added.

Use the official **2.5.5** package for the matching runtime, firmware, codecs,
installer and version/dependency metadata when staging. In particular, its release
ships encoder-library keyframe metadata and deployment-target repairs which are
not changes to these plugin sources. A source merge or local plugin rebuild alone
does not update those installed codec libraries. NVIDIA headers remain 615.78.08.

Build and source-retention records are identified by `out/upstream-merge-latest.json`.
The release plugin (`-O2`) and Tahoe accelerator compile, with no new warning
messages or accelerator kernel imports. Fourteen focused host checks pass,
covering real-sandbox decoder policy with mocked bridge access, decoder cleanup,
format-list filtering/fallback under ASan/UBSan, ANGLE defaults, cache/resource
lifetime, surface publication and retained source. The older GL descriptor fixture
failed identically on the pre-merge revision; update its mocks to the existing
uniform-buffer interface and retain its descriptor-reuse/state checks.
Validation is limited to host fixtures, source comparison and compilation; the
combined build still needs Discord/QuickTime, screen-capture, boot and physical
multi-display tests. This integration does not update the installed driver or
either existing package folder.

## Historical upstream 2.5.4 integration

Two files had textual conflicts: `CHANGELOG.md` and the ANGLE policy in `plugin/NVMTLDevice.m`.
Keep the fork history and upstream release entries. Upstream adds Discord to its browser-name allowlist;
the fork already covers Discord through its all-app default. Keep the broader default and
`NVMTL_ANGLE_METAL=0` opt-out once, without introducing a second constructor or a name filter.

Keep the H.264/HEVC registration access check, but do not restore upstream's blanket sandbox refusal.
Chromium checks local VideoToolbox hardware support before creating a decoder: suppressing registration
can reject H.264 without ever reaching the decoding service. Limit this exception to sandboxed Chromium
GPU processes, identified by the exact `--type=gpu-process` argument, without an app-name allowlist.
Respect the `--` terminator and the last process-type switch. Register only after both accelerator RM
bridge client types can be opened; close both probe connections immediately and cache the decision
across codecs. QuickTime and other native sandboxed clients keep upstream's service path even when
they could open the bridge. Checking driver access alone was too broad: QuickTime used local NVDEC and
froze its picture near three seconds while the playback clock continued. Clients denied access also
defer to the decoding service. Preserve the service/suffixed-name exception, decoder disable switches,
WindowServer exclusion and asynchronous
service registration. Encoder registration and the ANGLE policy remain independent.

On RTX 2060 Super / Tahoe 26.7.1, an isolated copy of Discord's Electron 42.11.15 reproduced
`kUnsupportedConfig` with zero H.264 frames before the initial repair. Restarting Discord confirmed
uploaded chat videos played with picture and sound, with its GPU sandbox still active. After narrowing
the exception, generated H.264 and HEVC clips decoded 642 and 644 frames respectively in the isolated
Electron test, with zero reported drops or playback errors and no diagnostic shim. The user confirmed
normal QuickTime playback of a 1920x1080 H.264/Opus clip that had frozen with the broader check; its
restarted process no longer loaded local NVDEC libraries. CPU checks cover
denied or missing clients, connection cleanup, cached decisions, the service exception, native clients,
custom helper names and exact process-type parsing (`tools/test_video_registration.py`). Other GPUs
and sandbox profiles have not been tested.

Take upstream's headless deadline check: if no NVIDIA head has published and no other GPU or
`NMIntelFB` owns the display, leave `MetalPluginName` withheld so WindowServer can use the firmware
framebuffer without acceleration. Existing early handover and Intel-panel handling remain. This
does not change normal display arming, parking, scanout allocation or flip verification.

Take the `nv_parms` repair as a null-terminated data table rather than a function stub. Its name/data
layout matches NVIDIA 615.78.08's registry-option parser. This changes the main RM and needs the
matching 2.5.4 RM binary when packaging; a plugin or accelerator rebuild alone does not include it.
Take the installer deny-only ACL handling, third-party kext failure diagnostics and installed licence texts.

No new equivalents of the remaining local fixes were added. The framebuffer, cursor shutdown/drain,
translator, native NVK, GL/MoltenVK caches, uniform-buffer promotion, bounded vector-prefix loads,
16-way sampler retry, specialization/pointer-escape guards, stencil and badge repairs, submission-copy
cache and release `-O2` are unchanged from the preceding fork. Parked-backing restoration and
upstream's conditional completion/capture synchronization remain included once. Keep the retired
experimental framebuffer policies and unconditional Dock wait removed.

Build/source-retention records are identified by `out/upstream-merge-latest.json`. Use NVIDIA
615.78.08 headers and matching official **2.5.4** RM, runtime, codecs, firmware, installer, licence
directory and version/dependency metadata for a subsequent package. This source merge does not
update `~/Downloads/pkgroot` or the installed driver. Earlier hardware results do not validate
sandboxed video, headless fallback, boot options or performance for this combined build.

The release plugin (`-O2`) and Tahoe accelerator compile. The changed RM OS-interface file also
compiles as an object using the public headers' `NV_KERNEL_INTERFACE_LAYER` branch, and `nv_parms`
is emitted as data; this is not a linked RM or a vendor ABI check. Seven focused CPU checks cover
ANGLE defaults/overrides, headless conditions, the parameter-table walk, installer ACLs, third-party
kext diagnostics and licence inclusion. Installer/build shell syntax checks pass. No kernel-collection,
boot, sandboxed-video, GPU or performance test was run for this integration.

## Upstream 2.5.2 integration

Three files had textual conflicts: `CHANGELOG.md`, `kexts/NVRMFB/fb/nvrm-fb.cpp` and
`translator/wrapper/src/buffer_addresses.rs`. Keep the fork history alongside upstream's new releases.

The framebuffer keeps upstream's NVIDIA 615 output-LUT surfaces, hotplug/EDID/audio association,
connection notifications and opt-in deferred flip verification. Preserve the fork's cursor allocation
at kernel priority with ONCE, its stopping/gate checks, accepted-work counter and exported
`thread_call_cancel` followed by explicit drain. Clean up `fConnectNotify` in the other worker list;
keep `fCursorCall` out of that list because its dedicated drain already freed it. Failed starts free
either allocated callback handle. Do not import `thread_call_cancel_wait`.

Keep upstream's descriptor path for data-dependent runtime arrays and its Uniform-table conversion
fallback when physical-address lowering is refused. Before mutating types, discover every supported
pointer chain to a fixed point. Check every operand for pointer escapes; a pointer stored as a value
must exclude its own root from logical retention even when the destination is another candidate root.
Keep table-helper/control-flow/store/return escape refusal. Clone all proven logical pointers,
independently of block order, after their pointee definitions and before their moved global variables.
Unsupported uses retain the existing descriptor fallback or controlled refusal; this does not add
helper-pointer support or general dynamic uniform-buffer promotion.

Take the remaining rendering, completion-witness, headless/startup, temperature and installer changes.
Keep upstream's default flip verification mode 1; mode 2 is opt-in and needs separate hardware testing.
The native NVK/Mesa source is unchanged. `nvAccelRestoreParkedForDirty` and GPU-current publication
are identical to upstream and must remain included once. The all-app ANGLE default, strict stencil
detection, stronger badge mip tracking, committed GL resource snapshots, argument-buffer routing,
guarded GL timing, submission-copy cache, MoltenVK binding/sampler caches and release `-O2` remain.
The experimental framebuffer allocation policies and unconditional Dock wait stay retired.

Use NVIDIA **615.78.08** headers. The fork build helpers now default to `~/ogkm615`; `OGKM` can name
another checkout. Public sources have no Darwin compile metadata or prelinked RM/KMS archives.
For packaging, use the official **2.5.2** RM, runtime, codecs, firmware and installer, preserve its
version/dependency metadata, and rebuild the plugin, translator, NVRMFB and Tahoe NVAccel. Do not reuse
the 2.4.3/610 RM or framebuffer as the new package base. The old 610-specific completion-archive
helper and vendor patches are historical; the 615 viewport patch belongs in a full matching vendor KMS build.

Compilation and source-retention records are identified by `out/upstream-merge-latest.json`.
The release plugin, translator, framebuffer and Tahoe accelerator compile with the 615.78.08
headers. Their source snapshots match the resolved merge. The translator exports the new
`nvmtl_table_to_uniform` fallback. Framebuffer imports add `OSString::metaClass` for display-audio
metadata and remove the old delayed-connect entry point; no unexported cancel/wait call is imported.
This integration does not stage/install or run automated tests, kernel-collection checks or GPU/runtime
measurements. Previous boots and performance results do not qualify this combination. The subsequent
local uniform-cbuf and shadow translation integration is documented below.

## GL uniform buffers and shadow translation follow-up

The previously separate uniform-cbuf source is now integrated locally on the 2.5.2 base,
including bounded integer-expression folding and the float32 stride-4 word extension.
Retain AIR name/access/address-space eligibility, fixed-range proof, supported-device limits,
separate binding-641 layouts, descriptor-layout/buffer/range cache identity and per-draw
alignment/range fallback to the original physical-address pipeline. Preserve the GL slot through
sampler specialization without replacing its specialized SPIR-V or attaching unspecialized AIR.
Keep both the promotion export and upstream's `nvmtl_table_to_uniform` export and fallback;
one does not replace the other. Keep release per-process disable/diagnostic switches.

The shadow repair targets the inliner's renamed actual first block. Retry-only sampler-phi
splitting is limited to sample/gather reads in the same block with dominating inputs, bounded
sampler fan-out and distinct generated names. Do not broaden this to arbitrary AIR calls or
duplicate texture writes/atomics. Shaders that translate as written keep their existing path.

The BSL/Complementary follow-up accepts 2 through 16 distinct incoming samplers on that retry;
17 stays refused. Preserve the same dominance, call-kind and use-site guards. For a shorter
32-bit float/int vector load through a wider vector GEP, load and bitcast only the requested
scalar lanes. The GEP's vector stride does not prove that the full vector is readable: an
8-byte prefix at offset 16 must work with a 24-byte buffer without reading to byte 32.
Keep this fallback after the earlier load handlers, including the reverse int-to-float case.
Preserve sampler/A8/threadgroup options across the pointer retry and refuse global pointer
captures before cbuf promotion, as established by the preceding translator repair.

The follow-up release translator compiles. CPU checks cover the prefix bounds, 9/16-sampler
translation, the 17-sampler refusal and retained specialization/cbuf behavior. An 84-module
public-input comparison retained identical bytes for all 68 previously translated inputs,
added one translated fixture and kept 15 controlled refusals. One descriptor-array assertion
also fails on the parent because this fork routes those textures through the heap; it is not
counted as a new regression. This does not qualify shader-pack visuals or FPS on hardware.

Framebuffer, cursor drain, NVAccel, native NVK and completion/parking policy are unchanged.
The user's other-machine success applies to the earlier uniform-cbuf build; the supplied shadow
report used offline text rewrites, and does not establish hardware correctness or FPS for this
integration. See [OpenGL performance](OPENGL-PERFORMANCE.md) for behavior, switches and limits.


## Historical upstream 2.4.3 integration

Two files had textual conflicts: `CHANGELOG.md` and the cursor allocation in
`kexts/NVRMFB/fb/nvrm-fb.cpp`. Keep the fork history alongside upstream's release entry. Take upstream's
`nvrmfbCall` helper and its ONCE allocations for vblank delivery, the fallback timer, hotplug/connect,
backlight, GPU wake, reflip and diagnostic workers. Each handle runs at most one invocation at a time;
different workers can still run concurrently. This extends the cursor serialization already in the fork.

Keep the fork's cursor allocation at `THREAD_CALL_PRIORITY_KERNEL` with `THREAD_CALL_OPTIONS_ONCE`,
its exported cancellation, outstanding accepted-work count/drain, stopping/status checks and failed-start
cleanup. Upstream uses HIGH priority for its helper and does not replace these cursor lifetime repairs.
The cursor scheduling, callback and stop/drain functions remain unchanged from the preceding fork.

Take upstream's AIR-text digest repair: mark internally produced long shader text and reuse its digest
state. The earlier mutable-string class check prevented reuse for CF-backed text. Cache keys and hashing
are unchanged; the new marker limits reuse to text the driver does not edit. Do not replace the existing
OpenGL/MoltenVK binding, sampler or resource caches with this separate optimization.

Main RM, NVAccel, Rust translator, BAR1 budgeting, scanout/modes, ANGLE defaults, strict stencil detection,
badge tracking, submission-copy caching, guarded GL timing and release `-O2` are unchanged by this merge.
Keep upstream's conditional completion policy; the unconditional Dock wait and experimental framebuffer
allocation policies remain retired.

Compilation records are under `out/upstream-2.4.3-merge-20261020-122844/`. The release plugin (`-O2`)
and framebuffer compile for x86_64 with a macOS 15.0 minimum. The framebuffer adds no undefined imports;
the unused `_thread_call_allocate` import is removed. Never introduce `thread_call_cancel_wait`.
No automated tests, kernel-collection
preflight, runtime/GPU checks or staging are performed for this merge. Before the next hardware test, use
the official 2.4.3 package and preserve its version/dependency plists while adding the fork outputs. The
previously verified fork build was 2.4.2; its boot and performance results do not qualify this combination.

## Historical upstream 2.4.2 integration

Only `CHANGELOG.md` had a textual conflict; retain both the fork history and new upstream entries.
The plugin's generation-specific Turing/Ampere H.264 and HEVC encoder registration and background stale
SPIR-V cache sweep merge alongside the existing fork behavior. Keep the matching codec libraries from the
official package. Cache pruning removes other translator builds' entries; it does not eliminate compilation
for a new translator. `NVMTL_SPVCACHE_KEEP_STALE` disables the sweep.

Take upstream's main RM power-source reporting and installer boot-guard job as provided. Firmware queries
read cached battery/mains state, refreshed at startup and power-state transitions outside firmware locks.
The new job treats WindowServer being present at two observations 45 seconds apart as a successful boot;
it does not verify a usable desktop or the same process. The existing kernel guard ordering is unchanged.

No new equivalents of the remaining fork-specific repairs were added in this update. Framebuffer, NVAccel
and translator source are unchanged from the preceding merge. Retain the kernel-priority ONCE cursor worker,
exported cancellation and outstanding-work drain, strict stencil detection, all-app ANGLE Metal default,
stronger badge mip tracking, guarded GL timing/resource/descriptor repairs, MoltenVK caches, submission-copy
caching and release `-O2`. Keep upstream's parked-backing restoration, scanout/allocation and conditional
WindowServer completion policy once; the old unconditional Dock wait and experimental framebuffer remain retired.

Use the official **2.4.2** package for the main RM, matching runtime, codecs, firmware, installer and version
metadata. Upstream reports that 2.4 shipped an outdated framebuffer binary and 2.4.1 still had a main RM built
without a required display interface; 2.4.2 corrects those release builds. Do not use either older package as
the staging base. Local NVIDIA headers still lack the Darwin RM/KMS archives needed to link the main RM.

Build/staging records are under `out/tahoe-2.4.2-stage-20261020-081614/`. The release plugin, framebuffer
and Tahoe accelerator compile successfully. The preceding signed fork translator is reused after checking
all 381 tracked translator inputs and its executable hash against the compiled snapshot. The staged
`~/Downloads/pkgroot` preserves 2.4.2 plist versions; both regenerated checksum manifests and all replacement
hashes pass. Kexts remain unsigned; userland signatures are verified. Validation is limited to source review, compilation, artifact
identity, signatures and package integrity; no automated tests, kernel-collection preflight or runtime/GPU
tests are run for this integration. Earlier successful boots and performance results do not qualify this build.

## Historical upstream 2.3.7 integration

Ten files had textual conflicts. Resolve the overlaps by behavior; do not reapply the earlier
OpenGL imports or parked-VRAM repair on top of upstream's equivalent code.

| Upstream inclusion | Fork decision |
| --- | --- |
| Parked-backing restoration and the earlier OpenGL/Minecraft and binding/sampler caches, included in 2.3.6. | Use the shared implementation once. NVAccel source now matches 2.3.7, including its plane-index bounds. |
| Fetch-disabled colour inputs and A8 render-target alpha/blend handling. | Keep both new upstream repairs alongside the existing ordered-triangle fetch path. |
| Dock badge mip filling. | Keep the fork's shared CPU/GPU eligibility checks, atomic root tracking, resolve/storage/view tracking, and checked row arithmetic. Upstream's simpler mip flag and broader GPU-copy fallback do not cover those guards. |
| Asynchronous cursor moves and refresh-aware OpenGL waits. | Keep the fork's serialized kernel-priority ONCE worker and exported cancellation/drain accounting; retain private-layout, timestamp, NVIDIA-backend and installation guards. |
| Default ANGLE Metal for Chrome/Chromium. | Keep the fork's enabled default for all apps, including Edge and Electron, with the same opt-out; retain upstream's activation log. The user reconfirmed this policy on 2026-10-19; do not narrow it to browser names or make Electron opt-in. |
| Submit-ahead from commit while the worker waits (PR 289), and single-field struct allocation repair (PR 291). | Take upstream's changes; keep committed-resource snapshots, uncertain-fence quarantine and upstream's conditional completion policy. |
| Private-copy installer and retired user NVKMS selectors (PRs 266 and 267). | Take upstream, including the follow-up that selects NVAccel from the checked copy. |

The branch also carries the 2.3.6 Tahoe icon/Liquid Glass regression repair: ask the translator for
visible-function references before deferring to pipeline linking, instead of depending on one error
message. Keep the fork's required function-constant checks, linked pixel-sampler variants and mesh/object
deferral. Preserve upstream's firmware-backup fallback and the card-mapping correction that accepts all
of the GPU's valid apertures, including display register windows; the earlier framebuffer-only restriction
caused WindowServer restarts. Keep the remaining upstream client/map-table, copy-region and shader-reader
bounds changes. NVRM source is identical to the release branch.

Still local: strict stencil marker detection, ANGLE Metal enabled by default for all apps,
submission-copy caching, release `-O2`, committed GL resource accounting, argument-buffer array/texel routing,
physical-pointer preflight/refusal, reflection/mipmap/constant repairs, serialized cursor shutdown and guarded
GL timing. The retired experimental framebuffer allocation/scanout policies remain removed.

The release plugin (`-O2`), translator, framebuffer and Tahoe accelerator compile for x86_64 with
macOS 15.0 as their minimum. The rebuilt framebuffer imports no new kernel symbols compared with the
preceding exported-cancellation repair. This is not a kernel-collection link or boot test.

Compilation and validation limits are recorded with the current build artifacts under
`out/upstream-2.3.7-merge-20261019-112636/`. The final staged package and review are recorded under
`out/tahoe-2.3.7-stage-20261019-115452/`. Five focused CPU fixtures passed: ANGLE environment overrides,
the all-app default (including Edge and Electron), surface pending-resource lifetime, overlapping surface
publication and GL committed-resource accounting. Both package manifests, userland signatures, output hashes
and all 503 saved source hashes were verified. No runtime/GPU checks were run for this integration.
Earlier successful boots, badge checks and performance measurements do not validate the combined
2.3.7 build or establish the gain from submit-ahead on the RTX 2060 Super. Recheck Dock previews, icons,
Terminal redraw, OpenGL/MoltenVK, window dragging and cursor/shutdown behavior after installation.

Use the official **2.3.7 package** for its matching main RM, runtime, installer and firmware layout, plus the
rebuilt fork plugin, translator, framebuffer and Tahoe accelerator. The local NVIDIA headers lack the Darwin
RM/KMS build metadata and archives needed to link a complete main RM, so reuse the official 2.3.7 NVRM binary;
its source is unchanged by this merge resolution. `pkgroot` and the installed driver are not updated by a source
merge or these compilation checks. Preserve package version metadata and refresh both checksum manifests when staging.

## WindowServer completion policy after the 2.3.7 integration

The fork's unconditional completion wait from `0b121d3` is retired. The user reports that official 2.3.7
already displays Dock previews correctly. That observation does not isolate the responsible change, but upstream
contains the explicit capture repair in `79f47d0`, strengthened by `40daaa6`: mark VRAM current at commit,
keep pending writes counted across command buffers, and wait at CPU page-off before copying unfinished pixels.
The 2.3.7 visible-function repair may also affect preview rendering; it has not been isolated here.

Restore upstream's `commitAndWaitUntilSubmitted` policy: WindowServer waits only until scheduled when NVAccel
accepts GPU marks, and waits until completed when it does not. `NVMTL_WS_WAIT_COMPLETION` still forces the
completion fallback, as does disabling the kernel marks. Preserve the surface/page-off synchronization and
submit-ahead coordination. Do not reintroduce the unconditional wait during a future merge based only on the
historical 2.1.0 preview result. The fork combination still needs fresh previews/capture and performance checks.

## Historical upstream 2.3.5 integration

The unconditional-wait decision in this historical section is superseded by the 2.3.7 policy above.

- The only textual conflict was `CHANGELOG.md`; both the fork additions and upstream release history are kept.
  The release plugin build also exposed a declaration of `nvtrace` colliding with the retained OpenGL
  call-site macro. Guard that declaration when the macro is already defined; keep the macro's argument-cost saving.
- NVRM and NVRMFB source remain identical to upstream. Keep its display-aware BAR1 budget, scanout lifetime,
  plugin-write cookies, capture ordering, refresh-derived flip waits, hardware-vblank retries and startup changes.
  Do not restore the retired experimental framebuffer policies.
- At this integration, upstream lacked the fork's parked-backing reactivation and unconditional WindowServer
  submit-and-wait completion wait, so both were retained. Restore the same parked allocation before upstream's dirty mark records its
  allocation cookie. Kernel-gated capture publication complements the Dock wait; it is not treated as proof
  that every offscreen consumer can safely use scheduling-only completion.
- Keep all ten OpenGL/Minecraft and MoltenVK commits below, strict stencil detection, Chromium's enabled default
  and release `-O2`. The new upstream remote release helper also uses `-O2`; the existing local build script
  retains its settings. Translator and native NVK sources are unchanged by this upstream update.
- Package against the official **2.3.5** RM/framebuffer and installer, with the rebuilt fork plugin and matching
  Tahoe accelerator. Reuse the fork translator built from the unchanged source. The prior 2.3.0 package is not
  the matching base for this merge.

The merged release plugin compiles for x86_64 with macOS 15.0 as its minimum and `-O2`; the Tahoe accelerator
also compiles. No runtime/GPU regression tests or boot of this combined build have been performed yet. Earlier
Minecraft results below, and the reported successful ReBAR-off boot before this integration, do not validate it.

The upstream boot guard is retained as provided. A previously identified source-level ordering concern remains:
NVRM checks the stored failure count, then increments it; later components read the incremented count against
the same limit. This is not a hardware-reproduced failure. A working boot alone does not cover the retry path.

## Earlier Tahoe and performance fixes to retain

- Tahoe icon rendering and System Settings/CoreImage glyph repairs.
- Parked-VRAM backing restoration before ordinary surface dirty updates, including the repair
  introduced by `eb6544b`.
- Upstream's capture/page-off synchronization and conditional completion fallback for WindowServer. The older
  unconditional Dock snapshot wait is retired on the 2.3.7 base.
- Dock badge mip initialization after full level-zero uploads. Keep the shared eligibility checks for CPU and
  buffer-copy uploads: single-layer, single-sample 8-bit 2D textures, at most 2048 pixels on either axis, with
  no explicitly authored higher mip levels. Preserve atomic root-texture tracking for uploads, copies, render
  attachments/resolves, storage bindings and application mip generation. Do not broaden automatic generation
  to integer/depth/compressed formats, array/cube/3D textures or texture views.
- Strict detection of the dedicated stencil-export push-constant block.
- ANGLE Metal enabled by default for all apps loading the plugin, including Chrome, Chromium, Edge and Electron.
  `NVMTL_ANGLE_METAL=0` skips the automatic workaround. Preserve existing ANGLE overrides and activation logging.
  This broader policy was reconfirmed by the user on 2026-10-19; do not adopt upstream's Electron opt-in default.
- Submission upload-discovery caching, copy-backing deduplication and release plugin `-O2`.
- Upstream framebuffer handling, framebuffer-resource allocation, scanout lifetime and GPU mapping.
  The experimental framebuffer policies and borrowed-scanout extension remain retired.
- Upstream's general Terminal framebuffer-fetch repair and event-driven flip/submission waits.

See [TAHOE.MD](../TAHOE.MD) for their implementation history and build/staging procedure.

## OpenGL/Minecraft and MoltenVK commits to retain

### Newer `perf` follow-up on 2.3.5

The follow-up adapts `8e88b38`, `e13b339` and `153fe3c` from pengubow's `perf` branch at
`153fe3c464aea4c76750720351134b4afb473d5b` into one fork commit. Its build scripts are not imported;
the older OpenGL changes and `0695972` declaration repair are already covered by this fork.

Retain these behaviors when reviewing an equivalent upstream implementation:

- Recognized `NSCGLSurface` waits use the window display's period when image-queue timing would impose a
  slower rate. Keep method/ivar layout checks, valid timestamp/rate bounds, a fallback IMP published before
  replacing the method, serialized installation and the `NVMTL_NO_GL_VBLANK_FIX` opt-out. The correction is
  gated on the NVIDIA backend; it does not alter `CAMetalLayer` or Vulkan swapchain methods.
- Cursor movement is coalesced onto a retained/drained framebuffer thread call. Position-only moves leave the
  cursor image surface alone. Allocate the worker with `THREAD_CALL_PRIORITY_KERNEL` and
  `THREAD_CALL_OPTIONS_ONCE`: one invocation can run and one rerun can be pending, using the latest cursor
  state. A default high-priority call permits overlapping workers to accumulate behind the display gate.
  Stop must cancel queued work with exported `thread_call_cancel`, then wait outside display/state locks for the
  outstanding cursor-work count. Register before enqueue, undo duplicate entries, and retire on cancellation or
  callback exit, including early stopping returns. This covers dispatched callbacks before their entry too.
  `thread_call_cancel_wait` is not exported to kexts; do not reintroduce it. Free only after draining. Recheck stopping after taking the display gate;
  freeing a call alone does not wait for a running callback. Keep the shared display gate and cursor-state lock. This is a
  targeted change from upstream's framebuffer; BAR1 allocation, primary scanout and display modes stay upstream's.
- GL completion queries count committed command buffers, including texture owners and buffer-backed textures.
  Reuse the last sealed part's immutable resource snapshot instead of allocating another list. Unknown fence
  completion keeps the snapshot alive and its resources busy, matching the existing in-flight quarantine.
- Heap-route eligible argument-buffer texture arrays and keep texel buffers on texel-view bindings. Skip
  per-draw plan allocation for heap-routed fields, bound other arrays by the shared texture/sampler slot limits,
  and check field-offset arithmetic. Sampler-token fallback is bounded by persistent sampler slots.
- Stage layouts carry one descriptor per binding: preserve the explicit refusal of larger/runtime/specialized
  non-heap descriptor arrays until layout, writes and binding plans support them together. Recognize texel arrays
  of one. Keep set-2 sampled-image heap arrays and ordinary buffer-internal arrays working.
- Preflight shared address-table pointer uses before physical-buffer lowering. Clone logical pointer types for
  supported chains/copies independently of traversal order; refuse helper/control-flow/store/return escapes rather
  than emitting mismatched pointer types. Keep the existing controlled descriptor fallback/refusal behavior.
- Preserve mip layers for arrays/cubes and halve 3D depth at each mip. Retain AIR-derived reflection and required
  function-constant errors while allowing the existing deferred mesh/object specialization.

All prior Tahoe, parked-VRAM, stencil, Chromium, `-O2` and OpenGL/MoltenVK cache fixes remain required.
For Dock captures use the current 2.3.7 completion policy above; badge mip tracking remains local.
Native NVK, NVRM and NVAccel are unchanged by this follow-up. Rebuild the plugin, translator and **NVRMFB**
for a test package; the stock 2.3.5 framebuffer lacks the asynchronous cursor change. The current staging helper
replaces only the framebuffer plist: the rebuilt framebuffer binary must also be included and checksums refreshed.

The three components compile and booted on the RTX 2060 Super / Tahoe 26.7.1. Eight CPU regression
harnesses pass; OpenGL, sampler-state, normalized MoltenVK and native Vulkan readbacks match their
references. The 30-second gameplay capture added no allocation failures, surface timeouts or refused/dropped
flips. The isolated OpenGL comparison measured the same rounded 2.8 ms/frame median as the parent; it
does not establish a Minecraft FPS improvement. Keep the committed-use regression harness and the submission
fixture's bookkeeping declaration. VSync-on pacing, sleep/wake, mode changes and other GPUs remain unqualified.
Earlier results below apply to their original builds. See [OpenGL performance](OPENGL-PERFORMANCE.md)
for the source commits and validation limits.

Two subsequent whole-machine failures on 2026-10-18 panicked with the high-priority thread-call pool at
500 threads, 499 blocked. The cursor worker's default allocation permits that accumulation, but the panic
reports lack the blocked-thread stacks needed to attribute it conclusively. The serialization repair above
was rebuilt, staged and confirmed loaded on RTX 2060 Super / Tahoe 26.7.1 by its matching UUID and
installed/package executable hashes. Extended runtime validation is ongoing; loading successfully and
the earlier short gameplay capture do not establish stability. Similar upstream freeze reports have not
been matched to this panic signature.

### Earlier imports

These ten commits follow `7f3c751`. Preserve their behavior when resolving upstream conflicts;
the benchmark-only commit provides supporting tools.

| Fork commit | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `ee4152f` | Minecraft OpenGL vertex shader translation. |
| `ff0f8d9` | OpenGL draw path, provoking vertex and texture-buffer views. |
| `34fd3e6` | OpenGL per-draw benchmark and path probe. |
| `16378da` | Remove per-draw allocations and retain the blit pipeline cache. |
| `fdbb5e1` | Reuse texel-buffer descriptor sets. |
| `fc13457` | Apply depth bias. |
| `c49edb2` | Honor per-instance vertex step rates. |
| `976d9ae` | Translate samplers and sampler arrays in mixed argument buffers. |
| `b0ba21d` | Harden resource caching, shader selection and render-state handling. |
| `d51bcd1` | Cache unchanged graphics bindings and sampler specialization keys. |

### OpenGL and translator requirements

- Retain the shader selection/dominance checks and zero-offset integer-vector load repair.
- Keep descriptor reuse sensitive to layout, buffer address, dynamic offset and table-page changes.
- Resource caches must keep the actual retained object alive, including when distinct objects compare equal.
- Reset primitive restart, provoking vertex and depth bias for each render encoder. Preserve the
  capability/profile checks and fallback for native last-vertex provoking behavior.
- Preserve supported instance divisors, texture-buffer format views and mixed argument-buffer samplers.

See [OpenGL performance](OPENGL-PERFORMANCE.md) for the selected source commits and test procedure.

### MoltenVK/NVMTL requirements from `d51bcd1`

- Cache graphics bindings per command recording and reset them for each new recording/event segment.
- Rebind when the pipeline, pipeline layout, descriptor sets, heap, set count or dynamic offsets/count change.
  Compute bindings use their separate bind point.
- Cache up to eight recent sampler-state keys per render encoder. Invalidate the active key when
  vertex/fragment sampler values or LOD clamps change, and preserve each pipeline's own variant lookup.
- Preserve resource retention, surface publication, completion waits and specialization refusal handling.

This commit changes NVMTL's submission path used by MoltenVK. It leaves the native NVK driver,
translator, kexts and framebuffer unchanged.

## Recorded results and limits

Hardware: RTX 2060 Super, 8 GiB BAR1, macOS Tahoe 26.7.1, 75 Hz display.

- Earlier OpenGL checks produced matching smooth/flat readback hashes and `GL_NO_ERROR` after installation.
  Short runs fell from roughly 16–21 ms/frame to 2–3 ms/frame. Background activity and the short baseline
  limit that comparison. A user screenshot showed Minecraft OpenGL at 149 FPS at 854×480; this was not a
  matched before/after gameplay test.
- For `d51bcd1`, five alternating runs per build of a normalized-sampler MoltenVK workload measured a median
  **5.3635 → 4.0128 ms/frame**, or **25.18% lower frame time**. The workload rendered 5,000 textured draws
  per frame into a 16×16 offscreen target for 40 measured frames. Readback matched the CPU reference.
  This result does not establish a Minecraft FPS increase or a native NVK performance improvement.
- Before staging, nine GPU state-transition cases and 23 surface publication/wrapper cases passed.
  OpenGL smooth/flat readbacks also matched between builds.
- After installation, Minecraft and WindowServer loaded the new plugin. A repeat 30-second sample during
  windowed play, with a 35-second counter capture, recorded no additional surface timeouts, allocation
  failures, flip refusals or drops. The surface-timeout counter stayed at nine; those earlier boot events
  remain unattributed. No explicit GPU fault/reset/device-lost messages appeared in the matching log interval.
- In that windowed sample, 3,214 of 5,067 render-thread samples (**63.43%**) were in drawable acquisition.
  The refresh-linked presentation ceiling remains unresolved: the earlier game test reached about 150 FPS
  at 75 Hz and 120 FPS at 60 Hz, and direct Metal reproduced the ceiling. Fullscreen switching is not
  required for the drawable wait. Sample percentages are not FPS measurements.
- An unnormalized-coordinate sampler test still fails through MoltenVK/NVMTL on both the older baseline
  and this candidate. Native NVK passes it. It was excluded from performance claims and remains unfixed.

All seven focused harnesses passed after the exact tested source was transferred into the fork:
