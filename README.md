# NullMoth NVIDIA Driver for macOS — NVK fork

Metal driver with native Zink OpenGL and Vulkan runtimes for **Intel macOS Sequoia 15.5+
and Tahoe 26**, with **NVIDIA Turing or newer** GPUs (GTX 16, RTX 20–50,
Quadro RTX). Based on [NullMoth's driver](https://github.com/nullmoth/nvidia-macos-driver).

**[Driver downloads](https://github.com/HighDelay/nvidia-macos-driver-nvk/releases)** ·

## Install — by hand

1. Configure [OpenCore](docs/OPENCORE-SETUP.md): required boot arguments, SIP,
   SecureBootModel, Lilu/AMFIPass and BIOS settings are listed there.
2. Download this fork's driver archive and extract its `pkgroot/` folder.
3. Run:

```sh
cd ~/Downloads/pkgroot
shasum -a 256 --strict -c SHA256SUMS --quiet
sudo ./install.sh
sudo shutdown -r now
```

Double-clicking `Install.command` is an alternative to running `install.sh`.
Follow any extension-approval instructions in **Privacy & Security** and reboot
when requested. The installer backs up the previous driver and rebuilds the
kernel collection. Do not also inject these kexts through `EFI/OC/Kexts`.

`Verify.command` checks the complete package and runs GPU/CGL diagnostics.
See the [package guide](docs/COMBINED-INSTALL.md).

The installer offers experimental **Intel laptop panel support** (`NMIntelFB`),
default **No**, for internal screens wired to an unsupported Intel GPU. Existing
opt-ins survive updates. See [when to enable it](docs/INTEL-PANEL.md).

## 1401 Mac app

Download the upstream [1401 Mac app](https://github.com/nullmoth/1401/releases),
open its disk image and run **1401**, then follow its installer. It automates OpenCore
configuration, driver installation and boot-menu recovery. Keep the OpenCore
boot disk connected while using it. This fork's Zink and native gaming runtimes
require **this fork's package**, installed using the method above.

## Uninstall / recovery

```sh
cd ~/Downloads/pkgroot
sudo ./uninstall.sh
sudo shutdown -r now
```

If macOS cannot start, follow the [Recovery removal steps](docs/COMBINED-INSTALL.md#recovery-removal)
using `nullmoth-remove=1`, then reinstall your previous working package.

## Minecraft native Vulkan

[Companion mod](https://github.com/HighDelay/minecraft-nvk) ·
[Aetherium — optional Vulkan shader mod](https://github.com/HighDelay/aetherium)

| Renderer | Application shader path |
| --- | --- |
| Apple OpenGL | OpenGL → Apple GL-on-Metal → NVMTL → NVK → GPU |
| Zink OpenGL | OpenGL → Mesa/Zink → native NVK → GPU |
| Vulkan / MoltenVK | Vulkan → MoltenVK → Metal → NVMTL → NVK → GPU |
| Vulkan / NVK Bridge | Vulkan → native NVK → GPU |

The native paths bypass Metal shader translation. Presentation still uses GPU
copies into Metal drawables and macOS composition; no controlled FPS gain is claimed.

### OpenGL through Zink

Install the Zink-enabled package for **Sequoia 15.5+ or Tahoe**, then launch
Minecraft with **OpenGL**. No companion mod, mod loader or JVM argument is
needed. F3/logs should show **zink** and **NVK**; Minecraft's VSync toggle works.

Minecraft gameplay is verified on Tahoe and Sequoia 15.8.1 / RTX 2070 SUPER
with 256 MiB BAR1, including the small-BAR crash and black-window repair.
[Compatibility, builds and test results](docs/ZINK-OPENGL.md).

### Official Vulkan renderer with NVK Bridge

Requires **Minecraft 26.3**, **Java 25**, and **Fabric 0.19.5+** or
**NeoForge 26.3.0.99+**.

1. Install this fork's driver with its Minecraft runtime and reboot.
2. Add the matching [NVK Bridge jar](https://github.com/HighDelay/minecraft-nvk/releases)
   (**0.1.2+**) to `mods/`.
3. Select **Vulkan**, restart Minecraft, and check F3 for **NVK Mesa**.

The mod finds the installed runtime automatically; no JVM argument is required.
[Full setup and custom runtime options](nvk/native-macos/INSTALL.md).

## Wine / CrossOver native Vulkan

The driver bundles native NVK, **DXVK for D3D11**, **vkd3d-proton for D3D12**,
DLSS Super Resolution support and an FPS HUD. This bypasses MoltenVK and NVMTL's
shader translation; Wine and DXVK/vkd3d remain.

**[Start with the complete Wine / CrossOver setup guide](nvk/wine-macos/INSTALL.md)**
for a compatible Wine build, prefix/bottle creation, DXVK installation and launch
commands. D3D12/DLSS are optional steps **after** that setup. The provider lives at
`/Library/GPUBundles/nvmtl/wine`; Wine itself is installed separately.

For **ZZZ, Genshin Impact or Honkai: Star Rail**, use
[YAAGL NVK](https://github.com/HighDelay/yaagl-nvk/releases) and its
[setup guide](https://github.com/HighDelay/yaagl-nvk/blob/main/docs/NVK.md).
It downloads Wine and uses this driver's installed graphics runtime.
ZZZ/HSR Global gameplay and ZZZ D3D12/DLSS SR are verified; GI and commercial CrossOver
remain unqualified. DLSSG and ray tracing are unqualified.

## OBS display capture

OBS compatibility is **enabled automatically for OBS only**: Apple's OpenGL
renderer plus **8-bit BGRA SDR capture**. Other apps continue using Zink.
Select your display in **macOS Screen Capture**.
[Details and opt-out](docs/ZINK-OPENGL.md#obs-display-capture-compatibility).

## Build from source

Requires Xcode 16+, Rust (stable), Meson/Ninja, and NVIDIA's
`open-gpu-kernel-modules` at **615.78.08**.

```sh
build/build_xlate.sh
RELEASE=1 build/build_plugin.sh
build/build263.sh
build/accel_build.sh <src> <out>
build/accel_build_all.sh kexts/NVRM <out>
```

These build the translator, Metal plugin, NVK, kexts and both OS accelerators.
Apply `nvk/nvk-macos.patch` to Mesa **17ca6174** before building NVK.
Rebuild **both accelerators** whenever `nvrm_vram_abi.h` or `nvrm_gpuva_abi.h`
changes. [Zink build and packaging instructions](docs/ZINK-OPENGL.md#building-locally).
